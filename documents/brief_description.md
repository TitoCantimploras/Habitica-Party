## Â· Party Purpose :star2:

A new guild rises from the ashes of procrastinationâ€¦ YOUR guild. We are warriors of routine, mages of mindfulness, rogues of responsibility. And weâ€™re looking for more adventurers to join our quest! Join us in daily missions, epic to-dos, and habit-slaying battles! Whether you're trying to build better habits, level up your real life, or just want an awesome party to share the grind withâ€”we've got a place for you.

If a member does not log in for 4 days, we will remove him/her from our team. Don't worry, if you want to rejoin us later, just send me a private message.

## Â· Rules :traffic_light:

 * Normally, we will end the participation of the next quest at **15 o'clock** on the day after the completion of the previous one. (UTC + 0)

 * However, in order to ensure the efficient completion of the quest, after 10 hours or more, we will directly start it if only a minority of those who were **already   
   logged** in that day are not involved. (I'm sorry if not everyone has been taken care of.)

 * Therefore, if you care a lot about quest participation, I strongly recommend that you keep a close eye on its completion to predict when the next quest will open to 
   avoid missing it.

 * Anyone can initiate a quest, but they need to complete the same series in order first. (If all of the same series are completed, you can choose what you like.)

 * We only use your **last login time** to determine if you're still using habitica, so don't worry too much about it.

 * If a member does not log in for `4 days`, we will remove `him/her` from our team. Don't worry, if you want to rejoin us later, just send me a private message.
